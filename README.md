**CirclePanel**

Create a java program that detects whether the mouse is clicked in, inside or outside a circle. The circle should have a radius of 50 with its origin placed at a user-defined point on the JPanel. The program shall prompt the user to define the origin by clicking the mouse on the JPanel. If the user makes an origin that will result in a circle not fully contained within the JPanel's dimensions, the program shall return an error and prompt the user to make another selection. Once the user defines valid coordinates for the origin, the program draws the circle and prompts the user to click the mouse anywhere in the JPanel. When the user clicks the mouse, the program should draw a line from the circle's origin to the location of the mouse click. Finally, JOptionPane should display the distance and a message that indicates whether the mouse was clicked inside or outside the circle.%
